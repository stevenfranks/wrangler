# Changelog

## üéÅ 1.3.0

- ### Features

  - **Environments - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/385][pull/386]**

    Wrangler 1.3.0 includes supports for **environments**, allowing developers to deploy Workers projects to multiple places. For instance, an application can be deployed to a production URL _and_ a staging URL, without having to juggle multiple configuration files.

    To use environments, you can now pass in `[env.$env_name]` properties in your `wrangler.toml`. Here's an example:

    ```toml
    type = "webpack"
    name = "my-worker-dev"
    account_id = "12345678901234567890"
    zone_id = "09876543210987654321"
    workers_dot_dev = false

    [env.staging]
    name = "my-worker-staging"
    route = "staging.example.com/*"

    [env.production]
    name = "my-worker"
    route = "example.com/*"
    ```

    With multiple environments defined, `wrangler build`, `wrangler preview`, and `wrangler publish` now accept a `--env` flag to indicate what environment you'd like to use, for instance, `wrangler publish --env production`.

    To support developers transitioning to environments, we've written documentation for the feature, including further information about deprecations and advanced usage. [Check out the documentation here!](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/blob/master/docs/environments.md)

  - **KV commands - [ashleymichal], [gabbifish], [issue/339][pull/405]**

    Wrangler 1.3.0 includes commands for managing and updating [Workers KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/) namespaces, keys, and values directly from the CLI.

    - `wrangler kv:namespace`

      `wrangler kv:namespace` allows developers to `create`, `list`, and `delete` KV namespaces, from the CLI. This allows Wrangler users to configure new namespaces without having to navigate into the Cloudflare Web UI to manage namespaces. Once a namespace has been created, Wrangler will even give you the exact configuration to copy into your `wrangler.toml` to begin using your new namespace in your project. Neat!

      ```console
      $ wrangler kv:namespace create "MY_KV"
      üåÄ  Creating namespace with title "worker-MY_KV"
      ‚ú®  Success: WorkersKvNamespace {
        id: "e29b263ab50e42ce9b637fa8370175e8",
        title: "worker-MY_KV",
      }
      ‚ú®  Add the following to your wrangler.toml:
      kv-namespaces = [
        { binding = "MY_KV", id = "e29b263ab50e42ce9b637fa8370175e8" }
      ]
      ```

    - `wrangler kv:key`

      `wrangler kv:key` gives CLI users access to reading, listing, and updating KV keys inside of a namespace. For instance, given a namespace with the binding `KV`, you can directly set keys and values from the CLI, including passing expiration data, such as below:

      ```console
      $ wrangler kv:key put --binding=KV "key" "value" --ttl=10000
      ‚ú®  Success
      ```

    - `wrangler kv:bulk`

      `wrangler kv:bulk` can be used to quickly upload or remove a large number of values from Workers KV, by accepting a JSON file containing KV data. Let's define a JSON file, `data.json`:

      ```json
      [
        {
          "key": "test_key",
          "value": "test_value",
          "expiration_ttl": 3600
        },
        {
          "key": "test_key2",
          "value": "test_value2",
          "expiration_ttl": 3600
        }
      ]
      ```

      By calling `wrangler kv:bulk put --binding=KV data.json`, I can quickly create two new keys in Workers KV - `test_key` and `test_key2`, with the corresponding values `test_value` and `test_value2`:

      ```console
      $ wrangler kv:bulk put --binding=KV data.json
      ‚ú®  Success
      ```

    The KV subcommands in Wrangler 1.3.0 make it super easy to comfortably query and manage your Workers KV data without ever having to leave the command-line. For more information on the available commands and their usage, see [the documentation](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/blob/feat-kv-commands/docs/content/kv_commands.md). ü§Ø

## üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 1.2.0

- ### Features

  - **Implement live previewing for wrangler - [xortive], [pull/451]**

    The `wrangler preview` command now supports live previewing! As you develop your project, you can start up a link between your local codebase and the preview service by running `wrangler preview --watch`. Any updates to your project will be passed to the preview service, allowing you to instantly see any changes to your project. This is a _massive_ improvement to the development process for building applications with Workers, and we're super excited to ship it!

    A huge shout-out to @xortive, who almost single-handedly built this feature during his summer internship at Cloudflare, over the last few months. Amazing work! üòç

  - **Authenticate calls to preview service when possible - [ashleymichal], [issue/423][issue/431] [pull/429]**

    This PR allows developers to use the preview service with account and user-specific functionality, such as KV support inside of the preview service. Previously, attempting to preview a Workers project with KV bindings would cause an error - this PR fixes that, by allowing `wrangler preview` to make authenticated calls to the preview service.

## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 1.1.1

- ### Features

  - **Install current version, not latest - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/418][pull/419]**

    Previously the NPM installer for wrangler would always pull the most recent release from Github releases, and the installer did not increase version numbers when Wrangler did. Many users found this confusing. Now the installer will increment versions along with Wrangler releases, and point at specific versions rather than the most recent one at the time of installation.

  - **Improve JSON errors debuggability - [xtuc], [pull/394]**

    This PR improves JSON error output in `wrangler`. Specifically:

    - If a `package.json` file fails to decode, `wrangler` now emits a clearer error:

      ```
      $ wrangler build
      ‚¨áÔ∏è  Installing wranglerjs...
      ‚¨áÔ∏è  Installing wasm-pack...
      thread 'main' panicked at 'could not parse "./package.json": Error("expected `,` or `}`", line: 4, column: 3)', src/libcore/result.rs:999:5
      ```

    - If the `wranglerjs` backend returns invalid JSON, it now preserves the output file for further investigation. Note that the console doesn't print the output file location by default, and you will need to pass `RUST_LOG=info` while running `wrangler build`, and search for the `--output-file=FILE` argument passed to `wranglerjs`:

      ```
      $ RUST_LOG=info wrangler build
      ‚¨áÔ∏è Installing wasm-pack...
      [2019-08-09T19:28:48Z INFO  wrangler::commands::build::wranglerjs] Running "/Users/kristian/.nvm/versions/node/v12.1.0/bin/node" "/Users/kristian/src/workers/wrangler/wranglerjs" "--output-file=/var/folders/5x/yzqyqst11n518yl8xl7yv1f80000gp/T/.wranglerjs_output5eREv" # ...
      ```

    - If the preview service returns invalid JSON, it now emits a clearer error, and the full output can be seen by using `RUST_LOG=info`.

      Previously:

      ```
      $ wrangler preview
      ‚¨áÔ∏è Installing wasm-pack...
      ‚¨áÔ∏è Installing wranglerjs...
      ‚ú®   Built successfully.
      Error: Error("expected value", line: 2, column: 1)
      ```

      Now:

      ```
      $ wrangler preview
      ‚¨áÔ∏è Installing wranglerjs...
      ‚¨áÔ∏è Installing wasm-pack...
      ‚ú®   Built successfully, built project size is 1 MiB. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Your built project has grown past the 1MiB size limit and may fail to deploy. ‚ö†Ô∏è  ‚ú®

- ### Fixes

  - **Fix `wrangler config` for systems with non-unix EOL - [xortive], [issue/389][pull/399]**

    `wrangler config` was not properly truncating whitespace from the end of user input, resulting in a panic when trying to use `wrangler publish`, because `wrangler` would try to create an HTTP header with invalid characters. Now, `wrangler` will properly truncate extra whitespace (including `\r`) from the end of the input into `wrangler config`.

## üîë 1.1.0

Wrangler 1.1.0 includes a number of improvements to documentation and project stability, including:

- ### Security

  - **Change global config perm - [xtuc], [pull/286]**

    This PR improves the security of Wrangler's global config file, by restricting access to Wrangler's global user configuration file (`~/.wrangler/config/default.toml`) to the user who ran the wrangler config command. **For existing Wrangler users, please run `wrangler config` again on your machine!** This will fix the permissions of your global config file to be scoped to your user account.

    [xtuc]: https://github.com/xtuc
    [pull/286]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/286#event-2516759398

  - **Use stdin instead of arguments for wrangler config - [xtuc], [pull/329]**

    We've made the `wrangler config` command interactive ‚Äì¬†the previous version of the command, `wrangler config $email $apiKey`, would be captured by your terminal's history, often exposing that information in a `~/.bash_history` or a similar file. The new version of `wrangler config` will prompt you for your `email` and `api_key` via `stdin`.

    In addition, this PR also adds support for a `WRANGLER_HOME` environment variable, which will be the location for Wrangler's "home" directory, if you need to customize where Wrangler saves its configuration information.

    [pull/329]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/239

* ### Features

  - **Support KV Namespace Configuration - [ashleymichal], [pull/334], add check + error message for pre 1.1.0 kv namespace format - [xortive], [pull/369]**

    Wrangler now supports using [Workers KV][kv] namespaces in your project! To start using KV with your projects, create a namespace in the Cloduflare Dashboard, and the namespace information to your `wrangler.toml` configuration file. The `kv-namespaces` key requires setting a `binding` (the representation of your namespace in your code) and `id`, the namespace ID:

    ```toml
    # wrangler.toml

    [[kv-namespaces]]
    binding = "TODOS"
    id = "0f2ac74b498b48028cb68387c421e279"
    ```

    **If you were previously using the undocumented `kv-namespaces` support in your project config, you'll need to make a few changes to your project to use Wrangler 1.1.0!** KV namespaces now need to be created manually, in the Cloudflare Dashboard, to be able to use them in your Wrangler configuration - previous versions of Wrangler created the namespace for you, but the process is now manual, to allow developers to be more explicit about how their KV namespaces are created.

    For users of the previously undocumented `kv-namespaces` functionality in Wrangler, we've provided a warning and upgrade path, to help you upgrade your KV configuration in your project to the correct format:

    ```
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  As of 1.1.0 the kv-namespaces format has been stabilized ‚ö†Ô∏è
    üíÅ‚Äç  Please add a section like this in your `wrangler.toml` for each KV Namespace you wish to bind: üíÅ‚Äç

    [[kv-namespaces]]
    binding = "BINDING_NAME"
    id = "0f2ac74b498b48028cb68387c421e279"

    # binding is the variable name you wish to bind the namespace to in your script.
    # id is the namespace_id assigned to your kv namespace upon creation. e.g. (per namespace)

    Error: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Your project config has an error ‚ö†Ô∏è
    ```

  - **Use ENV variables to configure Wrangler - [AaronO], [pull/225]**

    Previously, Wrangler required a global configuration file to be able to run. As many users may use Wrangler in situations where they don't have an interactive terminal, meaning they can't instantiate a config file using `wrangler config`, this PR allows Wrangler to run even if the config file doesn't exist. This change means that users can also configure Wrangler exclusively with environment variables, using `$CF_API_KEY` for your Cloudflare API key, and `$CF_EMAIL` for your Cloudflare account email.

    It's super easy to grab a workers.dev subdomain using the `subdomain` command in `wrangler` ‚Äì¬†so easy, in fact, that many people were trying to use it without even having a Cloudflare account! `wrangler` now warns users when they attempt to add a subdomain without configuring their `account_id` in `wrangler.toml`, as well as when you've already registered a subdomain, or if the subdomain you're trying to register has already been claimed.

  - **Allow custom webpack configuration in wrangler.toml - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/246][pull/253]**

    If you'd like to bring your own Webpack config to your Workers project, you can now specify a `webpack_config` key in `wrangler.toml`:

    ```toml
    webpack_config: webpack.prod.js
    ```

  - **Show project size on build - [xtuc], [pull/205]**

    Once the build is finished, `wrangler` now prints the compressed size of the script, and, if available, the Wasm binary size:

    ```
    $ wrangler publish
    ‚¨áÔ∏è Installing wranglerjs...
    ‚¨áÔ∏è Installing wasm-pack...
    ‚ú®   Built successfully, built project size is 517 bytes. ‚ú®

  - **Add HTTP prefix to publish command output. - [elithrar], [pull/198]**

    Prefix "https://" in front of the "script available" output to allow shells to automatically detect it as a link. Many shells will allow you to click directly on the URL from inside the terminal (such as iTerm's "CMD-Click"), making it much easier to navigate to your subdomains, or any published Workers applications.

- ### ü§ï Fixes

  - **Remove OpenSSL installation step from README - [xortive], [issue/355][pull/356]**

    Due to an OpenSSL dependency in [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate/), Wrangler required developers to install OpenSSL as part of the setup process for using Wrangler. [Version 0.3.1](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate/pull/170) of `cargo-generate` has removed this requirement, and you no longer need to install OpenSSL manually to use Wrangler. Hooray!

  - **Fix issue previewing a project with KV namespaces - [ashleymichal], [pull/353]**

    This PR fixes a critical bug where using `wrangler preview` on a project with [Workers KV][kv] namespaces causes the command to throw an error.

  - **Enforce one Webpack entry in configuration - [xtuc], [pull/245]**

    `wrangler` now returns an error during the build process if you use a webpack configuration with more than one export ‚Äì¬†`wrangler` needs to have a single known export from webpack to know what to build!

  - **Update default template for Rust project type - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/309]**

    Previously, when passing `--type rust` to `wrangler generate`, the only indication that it worked was that the type in `wrangler.toml` was `rust`. There were no Rust files in the default template, for a Rust-type project. Now, when running `wrangler generate --type rust`, `wrangler` will use [rustwasm-worker-template](https://github.com/cloudflare/rustwasm-worker-template) when generating a new project.

    [pull/309]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/309

  - **Stop cleaning webpack build artifacts - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/307]**

    The configuration for Webpack projects in Wrangler was over-eager to clean build artifacts, which in the worst-case, caused Wrangler to remove source code for developers' projects - oops! This fix relaxes the Webpack cleaning process, to ensure that building a Wrangler project is a bit safer.

    [pull/307]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/307

  - **Correct binding format - [xtuc], [pull/260]**

    Previously, `wrangler` was incorrectly sending up a `binding` object to the Cloudflare API, whenever we attempted to update a script's bindings. This fix renames it to `bindings`, and uses an array, as per the Cloudflare API requirements.

    [xtuc]: https://github.com/xtuc
    [pull/260]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/260

  - **Correctly pass Wasm module - [xtuc], [pull/261]**

    To ensure that a wasm module is successfully passed between `wranglerjs` and `wrangler`, the wasm module is now encoded and decoded from base64, avoiding any potential loss of data.

    [xtuc]: https://github.com/xtuc
    [pull/261]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/261

  - **Check for `account_id` and `zone_id` before publishing - [xtuc], [issue/170][pull/192]**

    The `publish` subcommand in `wrangler` now ensures that you have an `account_id` and `zone_id` configured in your `wrangler.toml` file before attempting to publish, instead of failing during the publishing process.

  - **Fix Rust ref issue with `wranglerjs` builds - [xtuc], [pull/227]**

    When `wranglerjs` built a project, it incorrectly referred to the output of that build process without using a Rust reference - this PR fixes that issue and allows `wranglerjs` to correctly take your bundle, and your project's metadata, and put it all together in a nice little package to send up to the Cloudflare API. Hooray, working projects!

  - **Always use multipart upload - [ashleymichal], [issue/280][pull/328]**

    We've updated how Wrangler uploads projects to the Workers runtime - as Wrangler supports the entire Workers ecosystem (including tools like [Workers KV][kv], the publishing process should use [multipart forms](https://dev.to/sidthesloth92/understanding-html-form-encoding-url-encoded-and-multipart-forms-3lpa) to allow uploading all of the data that represents a Workers project in a single step.

  - **unify upload form building - [ashleymichal], [pull/329]**

    This PR brings consistency to the way that metadata is handled during Wrangler's `preview` and `build` commands: previously, a `metadata.json` file handled the bindings for your Wrangler project, but because it was handled differently for various project types (such as `webpack` or `rust`), it led to inconsistent behavior during the upload process. This PR removes usage of `metadata.json` in favor of building metadata for each project type in-memory, which will then be uploaded directly to Workers platform. This work is foundational for improved Workers KV support in Wrangler üôå

  - **Add user agent - [xtuc], [issue/234][pull/236]**

    For every outgoing request, `wrangler` includes a `User-Agent` header to clearly indicate to servers and APIs that a `wrangler` client is making a request: `wrangler/dev` in debug mode and `wrangler/$version` in release mode.

  - **Terminal messaging abstraction - [ashleymical], [issue/219][pull/263]**

    We've made improvements to Wrangler's terminal output functionality, with support for various log levels and implementations in Wrangler's API for easily using the log levels in future development.

    The new terminal output functionality can be used by importing the `terminal::message` crate:

    ```rust
    use crate::terminal::message;

    message::info("Building project") // "üíÅ‚Äç Building project"
    message::success("Your project has been deployed!") // "‚ú® Your project has been deployed!"

    // Other available functions:
    // message::warn, message::user_error, message::working, message::preview

  - **Remove pre-push hooks - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/308]**

    Previous versions of Wrangler included pre-push hooks to ensure that code was linted before being pushed up to Git. This hook made it difficult to manage in-progress work, so the hooks have been removed.

    [pull/308]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/308

  - **Use serde for metadata - [xtuc], [pull/285]**

    This change adds proper construction of the worker metadata, previously, it was an error-prone string.

- ### ü§ï Fixes

  - **Fix `publish` and `preview` bug for projects with a `-` - [jaysonsantos], [issue/36][pull/38]**

    Rust is a sometimes surprisingly opinionated language! When your `Cargo.toml` specifies a project
    name with a hyphen(`-`) in the name, the Rust compiler will implicitly understand this as a `_` for
    all imports and when it creates compiled artifacts it will name them with a `_`.

    The original implementation of `wrangler` skipped over this, and as a result would go looking for a
    wasm file with a `-` when it should have been looking for a `_`. This resulted in a bit of a gross
    error message that stated that a file was not found.

    We've fixed this now- so go ahead and name your packages with `-`s!
